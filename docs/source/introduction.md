# Introduction
Welcome to Pylot! Pylot is a fast, customizable flight simulator designed for accuracy and speed. Some features include

* Built-in graphics engine for real-time flight visualization
* High-fidelity, nonlinear numerical lifting-line aerodynamics simulation using [MachUpX](https://www.github.com/usuaero/MachUpX)
* Lightning-fast linearized aerodynamics simulation
* Parallized computation to increase real-time accuracy
* Extensive user customization

In this documentation, you'll find information for creating airplane models, defining inputs, and interacting with the simulator.

Please note that our physics engine does not currently support interations with the ground/solid objects (i.e. trees). We hope to include this functionality in a soon-to-be-released update for Pylot. Until then, you'll have to plan on staying in the air.
